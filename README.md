**Informations about build and running**

1. You'll need a prepared React Native capable of running command lines (e.g. "react-native run-ios or react-native run-android").
2. No especial components were used, so you probably won't have any problem building the app.

**Installing on a real Android device**
- Inside "bin" folder you'll find a relase-mode signed APK you can install and run normally in any Android device (compatible with Android KitKat and above).
